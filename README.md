# Bluesock-Fintech
Developed during my internship at Bluestock Fintech, this IPO web app displays public IPO info like price band, dates, and company details. I worked with Team K37, focusing on backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The platform also supports Offer ID verification and document downloads.
